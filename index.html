<hr>


<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Your task is to implement, in Java, code generators. As source
  language we take subsets of (a minor variant of) the simple language
  that we generated code for in the lectures (see
  the <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/mfb21/compilers/slides/12.pdf">lecture
  notes</a>, Page 4).  As usual, the language is represented by
  ASTs. The target language is MIPS machine code.
</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Background.</b> It might be
interesting to see the language you will have to compile in it's
conventional (non-AST) form. Here it is as a context free grammar.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
PROG &rarr; DEC | DEC; PROG 
DEC &rarr; def ID (VARDEC) = E
VARDEC &rarr;  &epsilon; | VARDECNE 
VARDECNE &rarr; ID | VARDECNE, ID 
ID &rarr; ... (identifiers)
INT &rarr; ... (Integers)
E &rarr;  INT 
  | ID 
  | if E COMP E then E else E endif
  | (E BINOP E)
  | (E)
  | skip
  | (E; E)
  | while E COMP E do E endwhile
  | repeat E until E COMP E endrepeat
  | ID := E
  | ID(ARGS)
  | break
  | continue
ARGS &rarr; &epsilon; | ARGSNE
ARGSNE &rarr; E | ARGSNE, E
COMP &rarr; == | < | > | <= | >=
BINOP &rarr; + | - | * | / 
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The ASTs for this language can be found <a href="common/asts.java">here</a>.
<font color=red>Do note change these definitions at all!
(except by adding new methods). If you change them in a way that my
  test suite will not compile, you will get 0 points.</font>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">An important difference from the
pseudo-code used in the lectures is that in declarations we use
numbers as variables (instead of strings).  Variable 1 refers to the
first (leftmost) variable in the declaration, variable 2 to the second
from the left and so on.  For example the procedure</p>

<blockquote>
def f(x,y,z) = { if x == y then z else 0 }
</blockquote>
becomes

<blockquote>
<pre>
Declaration ( "f", 
              3, 
              new If ( new Variable ( 1 ), 
                       new Equals (),
                       new Variable( 2 ),
                       new Variable( 3 ),
                       new IntLiteral ( 0 ) ) );
</pre>
</blockquote>


<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The meaning of <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> will be explained in
  <a href="task3/index.html">Task 3</a>.  Note that you don't have to
write a lexer or parser for this language, only a code generator. All
your code generators will use the following given classes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <b>Notes on the implementations.</b>  It is your task to implement
the code generators in Java. You will have to use the following interface and
exception to implement the code generators.
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
class CodegenException extends Exception {
    public String msg;
    public CodegenException ( String _msg ) { msg = _msg; } }

interface Codegen {
    public String codegen ( Program p ) throws CodegenException; }
</pre>
</blockquote>



<p style="text-align: justify;">
The MIPS code to be produced is returned by all these methods as a
string. Don't print out the generated code. Just return it as a
string.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You can download
these <a href="common/basic.java">here</a>. <font color=red>Do note
change these definitions at all!</font> If you change them, my test
suite will not compile and you will get 0 points. I will instantiate
your code generators with the following classes, one for each
task.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
  class Task1 {
     public static Codegen create () throws CodegenException { ... } }
  
  class Task2 {
     public static Codegen create () throws CodegenException { ... } }
  
  class Task3 {
     public static Codegen create () throws CodegenException { ... } }
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;">(You find these three code fragments
  <a href="common/codegen1.java">here</a>,
  <a href="common/codegen2.java">here</a> and
  <a href="common/codegen3.java">here</a>.) To implement e.g. Task 1, replace
  the <code>...</code>  with appropriate code that instantiates
  the <code>Codegen</code> interface. If you don't want to do a task,
  just throw a <code>CodegenException</code> exceptions
  in <code>create</code> instead.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;"> The
 <code>codegen</code> method is intended to generate code for a whole
 <code>p</code> of type <code>Program</code>.  The code generated for
 a whole program <code>p</code> includes preamble, data layout
 directives etc. The generated code should be valid and executable
 MIPS code.  You need to add alignment instructions and ensure that
 upon start of your program control is handed to the initial program,
 and upon termination control is handed back.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The code generators for Task 1 and Task 2 work only on subsets of the
language.  The test suite I will use for Task 1 will only use ASTs
that are valid programs in the subset of Task 1.  The test suite I
will use for Task 2 will only use ASTs that are valid programs in the
subset of Task 2. So it doesn't matter what your code generators for
these tasks do when they encounter ASTs that are not valid in the
relevant subsets. For example if you do Task 1 and 2, it makes sense
to write a code generator for Task 2, and then
let <code>Task1.create</code> as well as <code>Task2.create</code>
 return the same code generator.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The generated code must do the following.</p>

<ul>

<li> Be syntactically correct, meaning is must compiler.
  
<li> Generate syntactically correct code, meaning generated code must
  run in the MARS emulator.


<li> Implement the accumulator machine described in the lectures. You should use
  <code>$a0</code> as accumulator. The final result of the program
  should also be in <code>$a0</code>.  If you don't want to implement
  an accumulator machine, then please contact me beforehand and
  discuss this matter with me.

<li> Implement the meaning of the program correctly, i.e. 4+4 must evaluate
to 8 and so on.

<li> Should not lead to an error when being executed, e.g. due to memory
misalignment.

<li> Integers should be mapped to MIPS 32 bit integers, as described in the
lectures.  Note that you don't have to care about integer
overflow. All integers occurring in test-data will be sufficiently
small to avoid overflow.

</ul>


<p style="text-align: justify;">
You can assume that each program that I use to test your submission
definition defines at least one procedure.  You can also assume that
all declarations in a program have distinct names.  All programs are
valid, e.g. contain no type errors.  Moreover, the first declaration
in the declaration list of a program takes 0 arguments.  This first
declaration is to be executed first, i.e. it is the procedure that
should be executed when control is handed over to the code your code
generator produces. Note that the first procedure does <b>not</b> have
to be called <code>main</code>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Note that the test suite will call the <code>codegen</code>
  multiple times on the same object of type <code>Codegen</code>.
</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;"> Use the
provided <code>CodegenException</code> to signal errors or problems in
your code generator. Do not use other means of signalling errors. In
particular, please don't abort the program if you encounter a
problem.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>How to avoid common mistakes.</b>
Here is a list of suggestions that help you avoid common mistakes, all
  of which I've seen in plenty of submission last year:</p>

<ul>


<li> You'll need a function that generates fresh labels. Don't hardcode
  labels, ensure that the function generates a fresh label every time
  it is called. Don't use a random generator for this, use a
  global/static variable for this purpose. This is one of the few
  legitimate uses of global/static variables.

<li> If your sumission for the first assessed CW suffered from problems
  related to using instance variables where you should have used
  method-specific variables, ensure that you don't make this mistake
  again.

<li> The MIPS assumbly your submission needs to generate a string, which
  each new assembly command being on a new line. It's easy to forget a
  "\n" here or there, if you add them 'by hand'.  Hint: don't put them
  in by hand. Have your code generator generate an auxiliary list (or
  similar) of MIPS commands and then transform this into a string
  where the "\n" are automatically added. 

<li> Check that your submission is not miscompiling conditionals like
  <code>if</code>/<code>then</code>/<code>else</code> or loops in the
  sense that if the condition evaluates to <code>true</code> then
  the <code>else</code>-branch is executed and vice versa.

<li> Repeated implementations of the translation of conditionals: The
  source language has several places where conditionals need to be
  translated: <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>,
  and <code>repeat</code>. I recommend not to repeat the code
  generator for conditional three times, but have an auxiliary
  function generating the code, and calling that auxiliary method
  for <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>
  and <code>repeat</code>. Note that the conditional for repeat is the
  'other way round' in comparison with <code>while</code> so a joint
  translation method would a way of handling the two different ways of
  translating conditionals.

<li> I suggest that you split your code generator into at least the
  following three
  methods: <code>codegenProg</code>, <code>codegenDecl</code> and 
  <code>codegenExp</code> that translagte programs, declarations and
  expressions, respectively. You are welcome to have more (e.g. for
  comparison operations and arithmetic expressions).

<li> I suggest to ensure that your submission isn't 'noisy', meaning what
  you submit does not emit debug output: the problem with debug output
  is that it might be interpreted as MIPS assembly which leads to
  errors.

<li>
I strongly recommend testing your code before submission. Note that
    cutting/pasting code into MARS is insufficient as test, because
    that doesn't deal with the termination.

</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A small test suite that you can use will be made available
   <a href="tester.html">here</a> a little later. Since I will
  evaluate your submissions using a testing framework like the above,
  it is vital that you keep the relevant class signatures intact.

<!-- <ul> -->
  
<!--   <li> Please do not put your names on your submissions, -->
<!--     but do include your candidate number. -->
    
<!--   <li> Please put all your submissions programs into a single -->
<!--     directory that has your candidate ID as name.  I will compile your -->
<!--     submission that directory, and then running <code>javac -->
<!--     *.java</code>. If I cannot compile a submission, it will receive 0 -->
<!--     points. -->
    
<!--   <li> Please zip-archive or tar your submissions, containing -->
<!--     everything you want to submit. Submit only that archive as one -->
<!--     file. The name of your submitted file should contain your -->
<!--     candidate number, e.g. <code>23472.zip</code> -->
<!--     or <code>43923.tar</code>. Before you -->
<!--     submit, please check that your archives can be extracted. -->

<!--   <li> Your submissions should -->
<!--     <i>not</i> define a class <code>Main</code> -->
<!--      (or <code>main</code>).  More generally, you should not submit -->
<!--      any classes that define a <code>public static void -->
<!--      main(...)</code> method.  This is because my testing framework -->
<!--      will supply a <code>Main</code> class with a <code>public static -->
<!--      void main(...)</code> method to execute tests of your code. -->

<!--   <li> -->
<!--     Eclipse and other IDEs use different directory layouts, so if you -->
<!--     use Eclipse and the like, you will have to adapt the directory -->
<!--     structure to the submission requirements. -->

<!--   <li> If you use an IDE such as Eclipse or BlueJ, please make double -->
<!--     sure that your submission is in the right format.  Some IDEs -->
<!--     (e.g. BlueJ) may generate files with dependencies that I cannot -->
<!--     resolve as I don't have the relevant libraries, but that are -->
<!--     automatically resolved when using that IDE. -->

<!--   <li> You will have to use the code templates given to you. Do not -->
<!--       change the names and signatures of classes and methods given to -->
<!--       you. Of course you may extend classes, create new classes, -->
<!--       instantiate interfaces etc. But a program that is compiled -->
<!--       against the Java fragments you've been given as part of the -->
<!--       tasks should remain compilable with your modifications and -->
<!--       additions. -->

<!--   <li> I will run the tests using Java 7 (more precisely Java version -->
<!--     "1.7.0_25"). If you are planning to use Java features that are not -->
<!--     available in Java 7, please contact me. -->

<!--   <li> If you want to implement only parts of the tasks, you can throw a -->
<!--     suitable exception to instead of providing an implementation. -->

<!--   <li> Use the exception classes provided with the respective tasks to -->
<!--     signal that something went wrong. Do not signal errors in other ways. -->

<!--   <li> Please do not use Java's <code>package</code> construct. I know -->
<!--     that it is good Java style to use <code>package</code>, but using -->
<!--     it makes evaluating your submissions more difficult for me. -->
    
<!--   <li> To assure anonymity, do not put your names anywhere in your -->
<!--     submissions, but do include your candidate number somewhere, -->
<!--     preferably as the name of the submitted file. -->
    
<!-- </ul> -->

<!-- <hr> -->

<!-- <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Originality and plagiarism.</b> -->
<!-- Please don’t forget that the work submitted must be your own. For -->
<!-- example, it is completely unacceptable for two or more students to -->
<!-- collaborate on a program up to the point where it is typed into the -->
<!-- system. You may discuss the designs of your programs with each other -->
