<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <b>Submission guidelines.</b> Here are some recommendations for your
submission.  Your code should have the following properties.</p>

<ul>
  
  <li> To assure anonymity, do not put your names anywhere in your
    submissions, but do include your candidate number somewhere,
    preferably as the name of the submitted file.

  <li> Please make sure your submission isn't 'noisy'. In other words,
    when I run you code, it should not output debugging information.
    (Maybe look at all your <code>System.out.println (...)</code>
    statements: are they really needed?)
    
  <li> Please make sure the code you submit can be compiled by
  invoking
    <code>javac *.java</code>. In particular, you'll have to include
    the interface definitions that you have been
    given.  <font color=red>Code that cannot be compiled will receive
    0 points.</font>

  <li> You will have to use the code templates given to you. Do not
      change the names and signatures of classes and methods given to
      you. Of course you may extend classes, create new classes,
      instantiate interfaces etc. But a program that is compiled
      against the Java fragments you've been given as part of the
      tasks should remain compilable with your modifications and
      additions.

  <li> Note that classes you submit might be instantiated multiple
    times, and methods might get invoked more than once.  They should
    behave appropriately when used multiple times.

  <li> If your code encounters a problem, do throw one of the
exceptions defined in the tasks with an appropriate error message. Do
not throw other exceptions and don't exit the program (i.e. don't
use <code>System.exit( ... )</code> and the like).

  <li> Please put the submissions for each task into separate
    directories (called <code>task1</code>, <code>task2</code>,
    and <code>task3</code>). Each directory should
    contain <font color=red>all files</font> relevant for the task, in
    particular for compilation (where that makes sense).  I will
    compile e.g. your submission for Task 2 by going to
    directory <code>task2</code>, and then running <code>javac
    *.java</code>. <font color=red>Code does not adhere to this format
    will receive 0 points.</font> Please compile each task yourself
    before submission using <code>javac *.java</code> to ensure that
    your submission is compilable.

  <li> If you don't want to submit a solution for a task, omit the
  directory for that task.

  <li> Please put your whole submission into a single directory that
    has your candidate ID as name. This single directory will then
    have sub-directories <code>task1</code>, <code>task2</code>
    and <code>task3</code>.
    
  <li> Please zip-archive or tar your submissions, containing
    everything you want to submit. Submit only that archive as one
    file. The name of your submitted file should contain your
    candidate number, e.g. <code>23472.zip</code>
    or <code>43923.tar</code>. Before you
    submit, please check that your archives can be extracted.
    Do 
    <b>not</b> use <code>rar</code> to make your submission into one
    file: <code>rar</code> cannot be reliably un-<code>rar</code>ed on
    OSX and Linux.


  <li> Your submissions should
    <i>not</i> define a class <code>Main</code>
     (or <code>main</code>).  More generally, you should not submit
     any classes that define a <code>public static void
     main(...)</code> method.  This is because my testing framework
     will supply a <code>Main</code> class with a <code>public static
     void main(...)</code> method to execute tests of your code.

  <li>
    Eclipse and other IDEs use different directory layouts, so if you
    use Eclipse and the like, you will have to adapt the directory
    structure to the submission requirements.

  <li> If you use an IDE such as Eclipse or BlueJ, please make double
    sure that your submission is in the right format.  Some IDEs
    (e.g. BlueJ) may generate files with dependencies that I cannot
    resolve as I don't have the relevant libraries, but that are
    automatically resolved when using that IDE.


  <li> I will run the tests using Java 8 (more precisely Java version
    "javac 1.8.0_31"). If you are planning to use Java features that are not
    available in Java 8, please contact me.

  <li> Please do not use Java's <code>package</code> construct. I know
    that it is good Java style to use <code>package</code>, but using
    it makes evaluating your submissions more difficult for me.
        
</ul>

<hr>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Originality and plagiarism.</b>
Please donâ€™t forget that the work submitted must be your own. For
example, it is completely unacceptable for two or more students to
collaborate on a program up to the point where it is typed into the
system. You may discuss the designs of your programs with each other
in broad outline, but discussions at the level of program statements
are clearly unacceptable.  If you have not done so already, you would
be well advised to consult the University of Sussex Handbook
guidelines on the subjects of collusion and plagiarism:
